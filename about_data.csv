Growth rate and trends,"Asia-Pacific Region Anticipated to Witness Significant Growth Rising government emphasis on increasing the adoption of electric vehicles and the availability of incentives from the government for electric vehicles are expected to drive the demand for electric vehicles during the forecast period. Governing bodies of several countries from Europe North America and Asia-Pacific have announced their plans to phase out fuel-powered vehicles during the upcoming 10 years. This will also have a positive impact on the growth of electric vehicles during the forecast period. Asia-Pacific is expected to grow at a faster rate followed by Europe and North America as countries such as China and Japan are inclined toward innovation technology and the development of advanced electric vehicles. Moreover ASEAN countries are engaged in large electric mobility projects.China is a key player in the global electric vehicle industry. Moreover the government of China is encouraging people to adopt electric vehicles. The country is planning to completely switch to electric mobility by 2040. The Chinese electric passenger car market is also one of the largest worldwide and it has been growing rapidly over the last few years and is expected to grow higher in the forecast period which is also going to have a positive impact on the demand for electric vehicle parts and components market.Japan has one of the best electric vehicle ecosystems in the world. Automotive companies like Toyota and Nissan are taking steps toward building electric vehicles in the country. The developments in the hybrid and electric vehicle market can be gauged by the presence of a number of players in the country. These favorable factors are expected to drive the market for hybrid and electric vehicles in Japan.The Indian government has been formulating various strategies to reduce pollution in the country. For instance The country with its FAME and FAME II policies has been providing incentives to customers and attractive options for investors as well as manufacturers to set up EV plants to propel the nation toward the faster adoption of green vehicles. Additionally automobile manufacturers in India are also taking initiatives and investing in R&D practices to provide affordable electric cars in India.For instance in January 2023: Tata AutoComp Systems Limited (Tata AutoComp) displayed a wide range of parts that it has already localized and is offering to the EV segment. Tata AutoComp has also been working on lightweight products and solutions to help electric vehicles extend their range. Such factors are likely to drive market growth over the coming years.

competitors,"GlobalAfter a decade of rapid growth in 2020 the global electric car stock hit the 10 million mark a 43% increase over 2019 and representing a 1% stock share. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for two-thirds of new electric car registrations and two-thirds of the stock in 2020. China with 4.5 million electric cars has the largest fleet though in 2020 Europe had the largest annual increase to reach 3.2 million. Overall the global market for all types of cars was significantly affected by the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first part of 2020 saw new car registrations drop about one-third from the preceding year. This was partially offset by stronger activity in the second-half resulting in a 16% drop overall year-on-year. Notably with conventional and overall new car registrations falling global electric car sales share rose 70% to a record 4.6% in 2020.About 3 million new electric cars were registered in 2020. For the first time Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations. China followed with 1.2 million registrations and the United States registered 295 000 new electric cars.Numerous factors contributed to increased electric car registrations in 2020. Notably electric cars are gradually becoming more competitive in some countries on a total cost of ownership basis. Several governments provided or extended fiscal incentives that buffered electric car purchases from the downturn in car markets. EuropeOverall Europe’s car market contracted 22% in 2020. Yet new electric car registrations more than doubled to 1.4 million representing a sales share of 10%. In the large markets Germany registered 395 000 new electric cars and France registered 185 000.  The United Kingdom more than doubled registrations to reach 176 000. Electric cars in Norway reached a record high sales share of 75% up about one-third from 2019. Sales shares of electric cars exceeded 50% in Iceland 30% in Sweden and reached 25% in the Netherlands. This surge in electric car registrations in Europe despite the economic slump reflect two policy measures. First 2020 was the target year for the European Union’s CO2 emissions standards that limit the average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per kilometre driven for new cars. Second many European governments increased subsidy schemes for EVs as part of stimulus packages to counter the effects of the pandemic.In European countries BEV registrations accounted for 54% of electric car registrations in 2020 continuing to exceed those of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However the BEV registration level doubled from the previous year while the PHEV level thripled. The share of BEVs was particularly high in the Netherlands (82% of all electric car registrations) Norway (73%) United Kingdom (62%) and France (60%).ChinaThe overall car market in China was impacted by the panademic less than other regions. Total new car registrations were down about 9%. Registration of new electric cars was lower than the overall car market in the first-half of 2020. This trend reversed in the second-half as China constrained the panademic. The result was a sales share of 5.7% up from 4.8% in 2019. BEVs were about 80% of new electric cars registered. Key policy actions muted the incentives for the electric car market in China. Purchase subsidies were initially due to expire at the end of 2020 but following signals that they would be phased out more gradually prior to the pandemic by April 2020 and in the midst of the pandemic they were instead cut by 10% and exended through 2022. Reflecting economic concerns related to the pandemic several cities relaxed car licence policies allowing for more internal combustion engines vehicles to be registered to support local car industries. United StatesThe US car market declined 23% in 2020 though electric car registrations fell less than the overall market. In 2020 295 000 new electric cars were registered of which about 78% were BEVs down from 327 000 in 2019. Their sales share nudged up to 2%. Federal incentives decreased in 2020 due to the federal tax credits for Tesla and General Motors which account for the majority of electric car registrations reaching their limit.Other countriesElectric car markets in other countries were resilent in 2020. For example in Canada the new car market shrunk 21% while new electric car registrations were broadly unchanged from the previous year at 51 000. New Zealand is a notable exception. In spite of its strong pandemic response it saw a decline of 22% in new electric car registrations in 2020 in line with a car market decline of 21%. The decline seems to be largely related to exceptionally low EV registrations in April 2020 when New Zealand was in lockdown.Another exception is Japan where the overall new car market contracted 11% from the 2019 level while electric car registrations declined 25% in 2020. The electric car market in Japan has fallen in absolute and relative terms every year since 2017 when it peaked at 54 000 registrations and a 1% sales share. In 2020 there were 29 000 registrations and a 0.6% sales share."
